## üîç React AI Pattern Examples

### Conversation Example
```
User: "I love cooking Indian food"
React AI Pattern:
1. OBSERVE: User mentions cooking and Indian food
2. THINK: This indicates interest in cooking, Indian cuisine, culture
3. ACT: Generate response about cooking and suggest related tags
4. REFLECT: Learn that user is interested in culinary topics
```

### Tag Analysis Example
```
React AI Pattern:
1. OBSERVE: Analyze conversation for interest indicators
2. THINK: Identify patterns in cooking, culture, food mentions
3. ACT: Generate tags: cooking, indian_food, cuisine, cultural_interests
4. REFLECT: Validate tags against user preferences
```
